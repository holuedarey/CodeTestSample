# Code Test

### Movies and Actors Api Service.

This project is built using PHP as backend using OOP Concepts.


### API Options
- Movies CRUD with pagination (route for movies is /api/movies)
- Actors CRUD with pagination (route for actors is /api/actors)

### API Pagination
Api pagination can can be pass as page for page to access and size for number of query to return. 
 Example:  /api/movies?page=1&size=50
 and for single entry /api/movies?movieId=? or  /api/actors?actorId=? 




### Limitation
More clarity is nopt given on relation between actor and movies and this could imporve the experience of the Api and the client side consuming to enhance fast response time instead of multiple calls
